# la-republica-scraper

This repository downloads the daily news from the Colombian newspaper **La República** https://www.larepublica.co/

The steps performed are:

- The links to each news are obtained
- Access to each news
- The title, summary, and body of the news are extracted
- Each news is stored in a .txt file

Each time we run the scraper.py file, it will download the current day's news by creating a folder  where the program will store the information. Each folder is named with the date it was executed. All folders were stored in the main folder called `data` if this folder doesn't exist, the program will create it. 


## Requirements
- python
  - requests
  - lxml

You can install them with: 
```
pip3 install requests
pip3 install lxml
```
